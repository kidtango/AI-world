Life simulation that demonstrates [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) neural networks based on the Perceptron algorithm adjusting to a dynamic scenario.

Creatures dinamically learn how to move as a group while adjusting to changes.

When fully developed, creatures reproduce when close enough. After reproduction both parents loose half their mass and have an offspring of a quarter of the initial parents mass.

Creatures age on each cycle, aging translates into a loss of maximum possible speed. Creatures die when they loose all mobility.

The goal of the simulation is to keep creatures alive for as long as possible without reaching overall overpopulation or full extinction.
